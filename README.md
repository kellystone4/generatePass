</u>

<u>

## Goal: 

</u>
</center>

### Our goal for this assignment was create a random password generator using Javascript. Throughout the week, we've learned about 

<br>


Through this assignment, I utilized my developing knowledge of Javascript and Googling skills. Beginning this assignment wasn't easy since I was unsure of how to go about it, but once I broke down what the assignment was asking for through pseudo code, it started to come together. Throughout this project I learned so much about Javascript-alerts, prompts, loops, console uses, ect. It is so cool to learn how many interactive things Javascript can do to enhance your web page!

## Criteria:

Within this project, I included:

<center>

```
1. Password length of 8-128 characters
2. Lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
3. An alert for invalid input
4. Password displayed on the page
5. A random password generator
6. Working button for generation
 ```

## Issues with the project:

</u>

<br>

- Figuring out how to even start! 

    -  I solved this issue by breaking every part of the criteria in pseudo code, which helped me to organize my thoughts and start my code.

- Figuring out how to get the Password Generator Button to give output from the coding for the password generator.

    - To fix this, I realized all I needed was to add a simple 'float' to my image. This would make the text wrap around the image. Then, I added a margin to add space between my image and text. Below is an image of how it looked before and after I wrapped the text around the image (along with several other changes).
